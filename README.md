# Pretrained-CNNs-with-Explainable-AI-for-Fracture-Classification

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for fracture classification using pretrained CNN models, namely ResNet50 and DenseNet152, coupled with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The project aims to classify fractures in medical images using state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks and employs various Explainable AI methods such as Class Activation Maps (CAM) and Saliency Maps for interpretability and understanding of model predictions.

## Dataset
The FracAtlas dataset was utilized for this project. It is a comprehensive collection of medical images related to fractures. The dataset can be accessed via this link: [FracAtlas Dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02432-4)
